            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF Sir Edward Turner, and Anne Gardiner RESPONDENTS, AGAINST The PETITION of Dame <hi>MARY TÆ²RNER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIR <hi>William Ashton</hi> in consideration of a Marriage between <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry Eure</hi> Esq; with <hi>William Ashton</hi> his Son, Demises unto the said <hi>Henry Eure</hi> and <hi>Stephen Eure,</hi> certain Lands in <hi>Milton</hi> and <hi>Tingry</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford</hi> for Ninety-nine Years; The said <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Stephen Eure</hi> redemise the same to Sir <hi>William Ashton</hi> for Ninety-eight Years in trust for <hi>William Ashton</hi> his Son and the said <hi>Mary</hi> during their joynt Lives; and after in trust for the Survivour of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Ashton</hi> the Son dies, and <hi>Mary</hi> survives, and thereby becomes Intituled to the said <hi>Term</hi> in trust, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the remainder of the said <hi>Term,</hi> if she should so long live.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1653, Upon a Treaty of Marriage with the said <hi>Mary,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> Late Lord Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> settles a Joynture of 300 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> or more upon her (which the said <hi>Mary</hi> hath ever since, and at this day doth enjoy) and thereupon the Marriage takes effect; by Vertue whereof the said Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> became Intituled to the said Trust for the remainder of the said <hi>Term</hi> of Ninety-eight Years, if the said <hi>Mary</hi> should so long live.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> for and in Consideration of 2300 <hi>l.</hi> Grants and Releases (as by Law he might) the same to <hi>William Mole</hi> Esq; who had bought the Inheritance of the said Lands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Mole</hi> in Consideration of a Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>William Botiler</hi> Knight, (which said <hi>Anne</hi> by a second Marriage is become <hi>Anne Gardiner,</hi> one of the now Respondents) and of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his last Will and Testament, charges the said Lands with the Yearly Value of 180 <hi>l.</hi> payable to the said <hi>Anne Gardiner</hi> (which is all the settlement that was made upon the said <hi>Anne</hi> upon her Marriage) in lieu of a Joynture.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> in the Year 1676 dies, and Dame <hi>Mary</hi> the Relict of the said Sir <hi>Edward Turner,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits her Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> against Sir <hi>Edward Turner,</hi> Son and Heir of the said Sir <hi>Edward Turner,</hi> and the said <hi>Anne Gardiner</hi> to have the said Deeds of Demise and Redemise, to the end she might recover the said <hi>Term</hi> in Trust, and thereupon obtains a Decree.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> and the said <hi>Anne Gardiner</hi> presented a Petition of Appeal to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled, for the Reversal of the said Decree, and upon the <hi>Twenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>h</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> in the Year 1680. After due Consideration had of what was offered by the Council of either part, and hearing the Opinion of most of the Judges, that the Husband may dispose of the trust of a Chattel Interest of his Wifes without her consent (which was the single point in Question) it was Ordered and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal then in Parliament Assembled, that the said Decree from which the said Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> and <hi>Anne Gardiner</hi> had appealed, should be and was thereby Reversed; as by the Journal of the House of Lords in the Year 1680. doth and may more at large appear.</p>
            <p>There have been since the Year 1680. Several Parliaments holden, during all which time the said <hi>Anne Gardiner</hi> hath had the quiet Possession and Enjoyment of the said Rent Charge, in pursuance of the said Judgment and Order of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal then in Parliament Assembled, without any Molestation or Trouble given her by the Petitioner Dame <hi>Mary Turner</hi> or any other whosoever.</p>
            <p>This being the true State of the Case, It is Humbly Offered to Your Lordships Considerations, what Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Inconveniences may and will ensue to the Subjects in general, if after such Solemn Hearings, Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Judgments of the Highest Court of Judicature, there should be a Door open, or the least Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement given to call in Question, the Judgments and Decrees of this Honourable Court, and to controvert the same, without shewing any Ground or Reason so to do, but only upon a bare Prayer in a Petition, the rather, for that if such Prosecutions should be allowed, Causes would be endless, and no Man could ever know when he should have an end of his Suits, or have any fixed or certain Interest, so as to be able to dispose of any Estates which have been Controverted before Your Lordships in the High Court of Parliament.</p>
